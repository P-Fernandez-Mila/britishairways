# Welcome to British Airways MVP

**Disclaimer:** This project is not ready yet, is under development.

## **Stack**

This project has the following stack:

- NextJS
- React JS
- Tailwind
- Antd
- Jest

## **Approach**

The approach for the implementation is the following:

Create a BFF using NextJS, I did not know of BFF until started the Academy, I implemented a BFF that processes the responses of the API's provided for the exercise and return a JSON with digested data. This BFF is responsible of provide the information to the FE.
On the same NextJS project I created a FE using React for the UI components and Tailwind and Antd for styling.

Due to the tidy schedule I will implement the feature 100% before moving to the next feature, the style was implemented taking a mobile first approach and it is a secondary aspect of this project, I prioritize functionality over design.
